# Main info

To get the server running ASAP, do:

```bash
./launch_server.sh
```
This method also cleans after itself!


Otherwise, build as you normally would, to run do:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 [IMAGE ID] 
```

To see the site, go to *localhost:8000*.

Notice that this website is still a work in progress and doesn't represent the final result. Though, all feedback is welcome.

# What might change

- Static files are served using whitenoise, might change that to nginx.

- Databases are stored inside the containers, which I am unsure of. They will contain cached results from calling GPCRdb, so it might be better to do something different.
